# Python

## Zadanie_1

The first code is used to generate a list of random integers in the range <64,99> containing 100 elements.
Then it divides the elements into 2 subsets: odd numbers and even numbers. Next, it displays the information in which the subset of the sum of the element values is greater.
Then it calculates and displays the average value for each subset. The subset of even numbers is sorted in ascending order and the odd numbers in descending order.
Results are saved in a new, empty text file. Finally, the user is asked if he wants to draw the numbers again. If so, the new data is added to the result.txt file as well.

## Zadanie_2

The second code is to do a prediction of how much the user can save in a year. 
Once the user has entered their monthly incomes and expenses, the code calculates totals, averages, savings, highest values, and lowest values respectively for incomes and expenses.
The code uses a class structure. At the very end, the results are presented in graphs
